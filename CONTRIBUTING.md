# Contributing to AskYourDocs

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AskYourDocs! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ installed
- Git for version control
- Ollama installed and running
- Basic familiarity with RAG concepts

### Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.10+ installed
   - Poetry installed (`curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`)
   - Git for version control
   - Ollama installed and running (for testing)

2. **Fork and clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/askyourdocs.git
   cd askyourdocs
   ```

3. **Install dependencies with Poetry**:
   ```bash
   # Install all dependencies including dev tools
   poetry install --extras "all"
   
   # Run a basic command
    poetry run askyourdocs config show
   ```

4. **Alternative: Install with pip**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e ".[dev,gpu,remote]"
   ```

5. **Install pre-commit hooks**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

6. **Run tests to verify setup**:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   # or just: pytest (if in poetry shell)
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=askyourdocs

# Generate HTML coverage report
poetry run pytest --cov=askyourdocs --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_config.py

# Run tests with verbose output
poetry run pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for >90% test coverage
- Use meaningful test names that describe the behavior
- Mock external dependencies (Ollama, file system when appropriate)
- Include both positive and negative test cases

## üìù Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

### Formatting
```bash
# Format code with Black
poetry run black src/ tests/

# Lint and fix with Ruff
poetry run ruff check src/ tests/
poetry run ruff check --fix src/ tests/
```

### Linting
```bash
# Lint with Ruff
poetry run ruff check src/ tests/

# Type checking with MyPy
poetry run mypy src/

# Run all checks
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The pre-commit configuration automatically runs:
- Black (code formatting)
- Ruff (linting)
- MyPy (type checking)
- Poetry dependency checks
- Basic file checks

## üìã Contributing Guidelines

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Ensure all tests pass

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

4. **Push and create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Ensure quality checks pass**:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

### Code Review Process

All contributions go through code review:

1. **Automated checks** must pass (tests, linting, type checking)
2. **Manual review** by maintainers
3. **Integration testing** for significant changes
4. **Documentation updates** if needed

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Clear description** of the issue
2. **Steps to reproduce** the problem
3. **Expected vs actual behavior**
4. **Environment information**:
   - Python version
   - Poetry version (if using Poetry)
   - AskYourDocs version
   - Operating system
   - Ollama version
5. **Log output** (if available)
6. **Sample files** (if relevant and non-confidential)

## üí° Feature Requests

For new features, please:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Describe the use case** and motivation
3. **Propose a solution** if you have ideas
4. **Consider backwards compatibility**
5. **Think about configuration options**
